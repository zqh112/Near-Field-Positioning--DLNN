Abstract: In B5G and 6G wireless networks, large-scale antenna arrays introduce spherical wavefronts in the near-field region, presenting both opportunities and challenges for communication and positioning. To address this, we propose a novel near-field positioning method using a bio-inspired dendritic liquid neural network (DLNN). The DLNN features a multi-branch dendritic structure, with each neuron processing signals through multiple parallel dendrites and a dynamic gating mechanism to adapt the weighting and fusion of outputs. This enhances its ability to capture complex spatiotemporal features. Additionally, the liquid layer with leaky integration processes time-series data, enabling strong adaptability and robust temporal memory. Simulation results show that DLNN outperforms other deep learning models in localization accuracy and robustness, with RMSE values of 0.1706 meters at 40 dBm and 0.2642 meters at 10 dBm, compared to 0.2836 meters and 0.2986 meters from other models. Its inference latency of 0.0580 seconds demonstrates excellent accuracy, speed, and energy efficiency, making DLNN highly suitable for real-time positioning in resource-constrained environments.
